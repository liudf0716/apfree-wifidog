General questions

What is WiFiDog ?

   [47]WiFiDog is software used to create wireless hotspots. It is a
   next-generation alternative to [48][WWW] NoCat.

Who makes WiFiDog ?

   The technical team of [49]IleSansFil created and maintains
   [50]WiFiDog.

Who can use WiFiDog ?

   On the legal/licensing front, anyone can use [51]WiFiDog. It is free
   software released under the GPL license.

   On the practical front, we would like the answer to also be
   "everyone", however this would not be the truth. The main target user
   base of [52]WiFiDog is network administrators, hotspot administrators
   and hackers who "know what they're doing". Odds are that an average
   windows user would not benefit from, or be able to correctly setup and
   continually administer a [53]WiFiDog installation.

   If the software ever reaches a point of complete point-and-click ease
   that we feel average users can safely administer, we will update this
   document.

Who currently uses WiFiDog ?

   The following companies, organizations, groups or persons are known to
   use [54]WiFiDog on their hotspots:
     * [55]IleSansFil
     * [56][WWW] BC Wireless

What can it do ?

   See the [57]WiFiDog/FeatureList page for the feature list.

What is it composed of ?

   It is composed of 2 components:
    1. The client is a daemon process - this gets installed on every
       wireless router
    2. The auth server is a web application - this gets installed in a
       central location

What are the main differences between it and NoCat ?

   On the client side, it's smaller, has far fewer dependencies, and runs
   well on embedded devices.

   On the auth server side, it's more customizable, and is geared towards
   capitalizing the infrastructure for the purposes of building portals
   and communities.

How does it work ?

   The client daemon uses firewall rules to control traffic going through
   the router. When a new user tries to access a web site, the client
   will transparently re-direct them to the auth server where they can
   either log-in or sign-up. The client and the auth server then
   negotiate what to do with the client and either allow or deny them
   certain network access.

   The client also talks to the auth server every X minutes to update it
   on vital statistics including uptime, load, traffic count per client,
   and to let it know it's still there.

   Refer to the [58]WiFiDog/FlowDiagram document for some more details.

What does it run on ?

   The client runs on any linux machine that has a working
   netfilter+iptables installation.

   The auth server runs on any PHP-enabled web server.

Can I write my own client ?

   Sure, but why ? We've done all the work. The client is written in C
   and is extremely lightweight so that it runs comfortably in embedded
   environments such as the [59][WWW] Linksys WRT54G router.

   The client is time-tested and is fairly stable. It is used extensively
   in [60][WWW] IleSansFil's deployed hotspots.

Can I write my own auth server ?

   Again, we've done all the work. However our auth server at the time of
   this writing is not as polished as the client. Feel free to make it
   better or write your own from scratch. If you go with the later option
   you'll have to respect the same protocol the client uses for the whole
   system to work correctly.

What does it look like ?

   The client is a daemon process that runs in the background. It looks
   like zen, chi, the ether, zilch. It has no user interface.

   The auth server is a web application that can be customized via
   templates to look however you want it to look. To check out
   [61]IleSansFil's auth server installation see [62][WWW]
   https://auth.ilesansfil.org

The WiFiDog Client

What do I need ?

    1. Basic proficiency in a linux environment
    2. A linux OS with netfilter compiled into the kernel
    3. The iptables package
    4. The GNU C compiler (gcc). Other compilers may work, but we have
       not tested and will not support them.
    5. The latest [63]WiFiDog tarball which can be obtained from
       [64][WWW] SourceForge

Pre-installation

   This is where a lot of people run into problems, so let's state this
   in bold:

   MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WORKS FIRST BEFORE INTRODUCING [65]WiFiDog INTO
   THE ENVIRONMENT

   That especially means:
     * The router must boot properly
     * The router must bring up the interfaces properly
     * The router must set up the routes properly
     * The router must connect to the internet properly
     * DNS settings must be set or obtained properly. DNS must work.
     * DHCP settings (client, server or both) must be set or obtained
       properly.
     * If using NAT, the router must setup NAT/masquerading rules with
       iptables properly
     * Clients on the desired ([66]WiFi) network must be able to bind,
       associate, lease and connect the internet properly
     * All the above must happen automatically when the router starts or
       gets rebooted

   Do NOT proceed with installing [67]WiFiDog until you've satisfied the
   above. It will not work otherwise and you will waste lots of time.

Installation

   [68]WiFiDog, like many open source projects, is distributed with
   standard autotools utilities to make installation easy. Unpack the
   tarball, then follow the standard:
./configure
make
make install

Configuration

   Edit /etc/wifidog.conf and follow the instructions in the file. Things
   should be self-explanatory.

Running

   For the first time, run [69]WiFiDog with the following switches:
wifidog -f -d 7

   -f means to run in foreground (do not become a background daemon)

   -d 7 increases debug output level to the maximum

Testing

   As a client on the [70]WiFi network (or whatever interface is
   configured as the LAN interface in /etc/wifidog.conf), open a web
   browser and try to browse to your favourite web site.

   Monitor the output of the running [71]WiFiDog to see what it's doing.

The WiFiDog client on a linksys WRT54G

   Due to the lightness of the [72]WiFiDog client it is often installed
   inside the linksys WRT54G. There are some profound issues that arise
   with this setup that it warrants its own section in this FAQ:

What do I need ?

   You will need to have basic/full proficiency in a linux environment

   You need to re-flash your router with a hacker-friendly firmware
   called [73][WWW] OpenWRT. [74][WWW] Follow the user guide on the
   OpenWRT site to get this part done.

   Do not proceed until you've completed the above. We also recommend you
   spend some time familiarizing yourself with your new router's OS
   before introducing [75]WiFiDog into that environment. This especially
   includes the nvram settings, network interfaces and existing interface
   bridges.

Pre-installation

   The same rules apply as the pre-installation in a non-WRT54G
   environment above. Do not proceed until you've satisfied them. In
   summary: Make sure EVERYTHING works first.

Installation

Introduction

   Installation of the client on the WRT54G is a bit tricky. The space
   limitations on the device mean there is no compiler in the OpenWRT
   operating system. That means that you must compile the client on an
   external machine then transfer the compiled form onto the router.

   To complicate things more, if you compile your client regularly on a
   standard x86 desktop the produced binary will not run on the router
   due to the different type of processor (MIPS) on that router.

   What is needed is called cross-compilation, In that scenario you use
   an architecture (such as your x86 desktop) to produce binaries
   explicitly designed to run on a different architecture (your MIPS
   router).

   The above was the bad news since it makes things sound complicated.
   The good news is that it's not too complicated and we've built scripts
   to make this a snap for you. As a matter of fact, you've already done
   this before!

   Remember when you followed the OpenWRT building instructions ? Without
   knowing it, you already cross-compiled stuff! You used your desktop to
   cross-compile an entire operating system for the MIPS architecture
   which resulted in one compressed firmware image you installed on your
   router.

Compiling a MIPS-friendly WiFiDog

    1. Download the latest [76][WWW] WiFiDog tarball from sourceforge.
    2. Uncompress the tarball, enter the directory
    3. Run the following, replacing /usr/local/openwrt/ with wherever you
       unpacked the OpenWRT tarball earlier:

ipkg/rules BUILDROOT=/usr/local/openwrt/

   You're done. If all is well you should now have a new file named
   wifidog_1.1.0_mipsel.ipk (version number may be different depending on
   the tarball you downloaded).

Getting the new MIPS-friendly WiFiDog onto the router

   The .ipk is a data file for the simple "ipkg/i-Package" package
   manager already on your router. All that's needed now is to copy that
   file onto your router. If you have installed the dropbear SSH daemon
   package on your router you can use scp on your desktop to copy the
   .ipk file to the router. Otherwise copy that file to any web server
   you have access to, then use wget on the router to download the file
   from the web server.

   Either way, place the file in the /tmp/ directory on the router.

Actual installation

   Once you have the .ipk file on the router, use this command to install
   it:
ipkg install /tmp/wifidog_1.1.0_mipsel.ipk

   Once that is successful delete the .ipk file from /tmp/ to free the
   occupied memory.

Configuration, Running and Testing

   Same as the earlier section in a non-WRT54G environment

The intricate link between WiFiDog and OpenWRT

   Repeat after me:

   A [77]WiFiDog RUNNING ON AN OpenWRT INSTALLATION MUST HAVE BEEN
   COMPILED AGAINST THE SAME OpenWRT BUILDROOT USED TO CREATE THAT
   INSTALLATION

   What does that mean ?
    1. If you downloaded and compiled OpenWRT yourself, download and
       compile [78]WiFiDog yourself against the same buildroot - Do not
       use someone else's pre-compiled [79]WiFiDog
    2. If you downloaded a pre-compiled OpenWRT firmware image:
         1. Ask the person who built it to compile [80]WiFiDog for you
            against the same buildroot
         2. Or ask them for a copy of their OpenWRT buildroot so you may
            compile [81]WiFiDog against it

I am not comfortable with linux and don't know how to do all this compiling
stuff. Is there an easier way for me to get the WiFiDog client running on a
Linksys WRT54G ?

   You can use an OpenWRT and [82]WiFiDog compiled by someone else. They
   must be compiled by the same person against the same OpenWRT
   buildroot.

   [83]IleSansFil makes it's own pair of OpenWRT images and [84]WiFiDog
   .ipk compiled files available to the public:
     * You can download a pre-compiled OpenWRT firmware image [85][WWW]
       here
     * And you can download a compatible [86]WiFiDog .ipk file [87][WWW]
       here

   Look in the [88][WWW] OpenWRT site for instructions on how to re-flash
   your router with the firmware image (skip any download/building
   instructions).

   Then follow the above installation instructions for installing the
   [89]WiFiDog .ipk file into the OpenWRT-flashed router.

   Please note that the above saves you from the knowledge and time
   needed to compile and produced these binary files. It is however no
   magical cure for linux illiteracy. You need to be proficient enough in
   a unix environment to be able to telnet/ssh into the router and
   perform the outlined installation and configuration tasks. If you do
   not feel comfortable doing this we advise you consult with someone who
   is proficient in linux and networking.
