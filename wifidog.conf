# Parameter: GatewayID
# Default: default
# Optional
#
# Set this to the node ID on the auth server
# This is used to give a customized login page to the clients and for

# Parameter: GatewayInterface
# Default: NONE
# Mandatory
#
# Set this to the internal interface (typically your wifi interface).    
# Typically br0 for whiterussian, br-lan for kamikaze (by default the wifi interface is bridged with wired lan in openwrt)

# Default: WiFiDog
# Optional
#
# Define what name the HTTPD server will respond

# Parameter: CheckInterval
# Default: 60
# Optional
#
# How many seconds should we wait between timeout checks.  This is also
# how often the gateway will ping the auth server and how often it will

# a long time to switch to it's backup auth server(s).

# CheckInterval 60
